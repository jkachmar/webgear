# Next Steps
This brings us to the end of this guide. Here is some more information to take you further.

You can find a few example programs [in the source
repository](https://github.com/rkaippully/webgear/tree/master/webgear-examples). These will give you a good idea how
this library is used.

API reference documentation is available in haddock format [in
hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webgear-server).

We also have some [benchmarks](https://github.com/rkaippully/webgear/tree/master/webgear-benchmarks) against other
popular Haskell libraries. You may find the benchmark results [here](../static/bench-criterion-users.html). Take these
results with a pinch of salt. Typical real world applications could have very different performance characteristics
depending on a number of other factors. If in doubt, you should benchmark your application and not rely too much on
microbenchmarks such as these.
